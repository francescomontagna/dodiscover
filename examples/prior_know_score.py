Using prior knowledge in order-based algorithms for causal discovery
====================================================================

We illustrate how to exploit prior knowledge and assumptions
about the causal structure generating the data in the context of causal discovery with
order-based algorithms, presented in the example :ref:`example <ex-score-algorithm>`.
